At least 4000 residents of the county were left without power. ||Carroll County (High Wind) - The Carroll County 911 Center reported that many trees and power lines, at least 35, were blown down throughout the county. Widespread power outages were observed.||Cherokee County (High Wind) - The Cherokee County Emergency Management Director reported that more than 100 trees were down across the county. At least 40 roads were blocked from downed trees. Several homes sustained structural damage, at least 12 of which suffered moderate damage.

Seven homes were damaged during the wind storm, including one on Bearden Road that suffered significant damage. A female was initially trapped in the home, but was able to escape on her own. In addition, an individual was injured when they were struck by a tree limb. Thirty-five roads were blocked and closed from widespread downed trees. ||DeKalb County (High Wind) - The public reported that several trees and power lines were blown down in the northern part of the county, especially around Decatur.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall. ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties. Multiple reports of tornadoes were received from rural areas around the Spur, Girard, and Guthrie vicinities but no damages resulted.||In all, an estimated $41.3 million in damages and three injuries resulted from severe weather across the South Plains region of west Texas on the 16th.", "direct_injuries": 0, "state_fips": "48", "indirect_deaths": 0, "fips": "279", "key": "ag1zfmVvcy1wcm9qZWN0chgLEgtTdG9ybXNNb2RlbBiAgICA7bvNCQw", "magnitude_type": "", "tor_width": "", "day": 16, "name": "LAMB", "created": "2016-04-24T13:49:59.682390", "tor_f_scale": "", "modified": "2016-04-24T13:49:59.682440", "longitude": "-102.42", "magnitude": 1.0, "end_datetime": "2009-04-16T14:35:00", "indirect_injuries": 0}, {"tor_length": "1.5", "month": 4, "type_code": "C", "year": 2009, "timezone": "CST-6", "id": 166501, "crops_damage": 0.0, "direct_deaths": 0, "property_damage": 0.0, "state": "OKLAHOMA", "latitude": "35.1716", "type": "Tornado", "has_geo": true, "start_datetime": "2009-04-29T10:40:00", "description": "A complex of thunderstorms developed over westeTexas and moved northeast toward southwest Oklahoma.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall. ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties.
